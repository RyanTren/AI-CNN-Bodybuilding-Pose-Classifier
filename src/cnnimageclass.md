Here's a full deep CNN image classifier setup tailored for a laptop with integrated graphics (so it's lightweight), using your labels, matplotlib for visualization, and structured in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format. The notebook includes:

Image loading and preprocessing (with directories assumed).

CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Training with live loss/accuracy plots.

Evaluation with confusion matrix + classification report.
