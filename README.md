# AI-Image Processing Model on Predicting Winning Bodybuilder Contestants 

this is a rough draft...

### Define Clear Objectives
- What makes a winning bodybuilding pose?
- How will AI determine a better pose objectively?
- Will this be real-time evaluation or post-event analysis?
### Research & Literature Review
- Study pose estimation models like OpenPose, TensorFlow PoseNet, and Google Teachable Machine.
- Read IFBB’s official judging criteria (IFBB rules).
- Review machine learning applications in sports analytics.
### Dataset Collection
Options for dataset:
- Download images of bodybuilding poses from public sources.
- Use competition footage (YouTube, IFBB archives).
- Take your own photos in controlled environments (gym/stage).

Key considerations:
- Annotations: Label images based on symmetry, muscle definition, pose correctness.
- Preprocessing: Use OpenCV to remove background noise, enhance contrast, and normalize lighting.
### Select & Train AI Model
Baseline Model: Start with Google Teachable Machine (no-code approach).
Advanced Model: Train a deep learning model using:
TensorFlow/Keras for CNN-based image classification
Pose estimation models like PoseNet for body alignment analysis
OpenCV for image filtering, edge detection, and contrast analysis

Metrics for evaluation:
- Accuracy of AI’s scoring vs. human judges.
- Ability to detect muscle symmetry and proportion.
### Develop Evaluation System
- Build a web app or local program where users upload images.
- AI will analyze the pose and predict a score.
- Compare AI-generated scores with real competition results to test accuracy.
### Testing & Refinement
- Evaluate model performance on different lighting, angles, and physiques.
- Improve training data by augmenting images or adding new ones.
### Technical Report & Video Presentation
- Document your AI model selection, training process, and findings.
- Show AI evaluations alongside real competition scores in your video.
