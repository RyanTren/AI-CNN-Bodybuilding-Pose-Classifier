# CS3642 AI Semester Project - AI-Image Processing Model on Predicting Winning Bodybuilder Contestants

## requirements
- First have conda installed, then create an environment in the project's terminal.
```bash
# Create a fresh environment
conda create -n new-cv-env python=3.10
conda activate new-cv-env

# Install all required packages in order
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install tensorflow
conda install pillow h5py
```
- This will help us install all the tensorflow dependencies used to run the Keras Computer Vision model

Some takeways: 
- accuracy is not there... 
- need to use a better model or grow our data set
